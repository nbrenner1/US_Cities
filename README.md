This program reads in from a file containing information about major U.S. cities. This information includes city name, state in which the city resides, latitude, longitude, and population. The user can then enter a state to view all cities from that state included in the file as well as their coordinates and population. The program also returns the total population of all the cities from that state. Finally, this program outputs all cities with a population between 1 million and 2 million
